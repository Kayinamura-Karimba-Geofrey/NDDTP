## Database: `nddtp_logistics`

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `logistics_locations` | Pickup/delivery point catalog |

### Shipment Workflow

```
DRAFT → SCHEDULED → DISPATCHED → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED
                              ↘ DELAYED → IN_TRANSIT/DELIVERED
         Any pre-delivery → CANCELLED
         IN_TRANSIT/DISPATCHED → FAILED
```

### Events

`logistics.location.created`, `logistics.route.created`, `logistics.shipment.created/scheduled/dispatched/delivered/cancelled`, `logistics.tracking.updated`
